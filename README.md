# Cake News: better cake than fake

The project was done following the concepts of atomic design and CDD. It's really nice to see how mature the whole web ecosystem has become in the last few years. The most important tools and technologies utilized here were: ReactJS with Typescript, Storybook and styled-components. I really wanted to use Cypress and get a nice coverage of E2E tests, but given the time constraints, unfortunately something had to be cut out. The bulk of the project was done in two days.

The Github project was the tool of choice to keep track of what was done and how many tasks still had be addressed.

### Things I would like to add if I had more time:
- Redux & Redux Saga
- E2E Tests with Cypress
- Unit Tests with Jest

# Deliverables
The webapp is currently deployed on the Netlify platform. [Here](https://cake-news.netlify.app/) it is.
A page with the docs is also available [here](https://cake-news-docs.netlify.app/).

# Project setup
`yarn install`

`yarn start` to run the app.

`yarn build` generates the production ready bundle.

`yarn storybook` runs storybook.

I highly recommend you to run `yarn storybook` to see the components in isolation.
